# use Snyk JSON at HTML Mapper
The Snyk JSON to HTML Mapper takes the json outputted from `snyk test --json` and creates a local HTML file displaying the vulnerabilities discovered.

# How do I use it?

## Install or clone

First, Install the Snyk JSON to HTML Mapper using npm:

`npm install snyk-to-html -g`

Alternatively, you can skip this step, clone the repo and run the script locally (using `node ./snyk-to-html.js`)

## Generate the HTML report

Change directory to your package's root folder, then use of the two ways below to generate the HTML report.

1. Directly streaming the results to snyk-to-html:

   Run the following line to create a file called `results.html`:
   
   `snyk test --json | snyk-to-html -o results.html`

2. Using a temporary file:

   Generate JSON data by running `snyk test` and save the output to a file

   `snyk test --json > results.json`

   Pass the resulting JSON file to Snyk's JSON to HTML Mapper

   `snyk-to-html -i results.json -o results.html`

## View the HTML report

   Simply open your new file (`results.html` above) in a browser, and rejoice.
